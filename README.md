# YTHDF2-Analysis
This repository is for circularity analysis and single particle MSD analysis of wonkicholab.  
Site for wonkicholab: https://www.wonkicholab.com/  
  
**Circularity_analysis_CYS.M**  
  From the clusters using DBSCAN, we investigated the circularity of each cluster.  
    
**Alpha_D_MSD_analysis_GHK.m**  
  From the single particles' tracks using ImageJ TrackMate plug-in, we investigated the MSD, diffusion coefficient and alpha values.  
  In this code, we used MSD analyzer Matlab msdanalyzer class;  
    _Jean-Yves Tinevez (2022). Mean square displacement analysis of particles trajectories (https://github.com/tinevez/msdanalyzer), GitHub._  
   
These codes are optimized for wonkicholab, so you need to modify the code for use.  
The codes are run on the MATLAB.
